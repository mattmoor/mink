// This package holds the specification for the projectcontour.io Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
//
// In building this CRD, we've inadvertently overloaded the word "Condition", so we've tried to make
// this spec clear as to which types of condition are which.
//
// `MatchConditions` are used by `Routes` and `Includes` to specify rules to match requests against for either
// routing or inclusion.
//
// `DetailedConditions` are used in the `Status` of these objects to hold information about the relevant
// state of the object and the world around it.
//
// `SubConditions` are used underneath `DetailedConditions` to give more detail to errors or warnings.
