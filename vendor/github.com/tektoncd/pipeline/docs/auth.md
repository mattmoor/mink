# Authentication

This document defines how authentication is provided during execution of a
`TaskRun` or a `PipelineRun` (referred to as `Runs` in this document).

The build system supports two types of authentication, using Kubernetes'
first-class `Secret` types:

- `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`
- `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`

Secrets of these types can be made available to the `Run` by attaching them to
the `ServiceAccount` as which it runs.

## Exposing credentials

In their native form, these secrets are unsuitable for consumption by Git and
Docker. For Git, they need to be turned into (some form of) `.gitconfig`. For
Docker, they need to be turned into a `~/.docker/config.json` file. Also, while
each of these supports has multiple credentials for multiple domains, those
credentials typically need to be blended into a single canonical keyring.

To solve this, before any `PipelineResources` are retrieved, all `pods` execute
a credential initialization process that accesses each of its secrets and
aggregates them into their respective files in `$HOME`.

## SSH authentication (Git)

1. Define a `Secret` containing your SSH private key (in `secret.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: ssh-key
     annotations:
       tekton.dev/git-0: github.com # Described below
   type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
   data:
     ssh-privatekey: <base64 encoded>
     # This is non-standard, but its use is encouraged to make this more secure.
     known_hosts: <base64 encoded>
   ```

   `tekton.dev/git-0` in the example above specifies which web address these
   credentials belong to. See
   [Guiding Credential Selection](#guiding-credential-selection) below for more
   information.

1. Generate the value of `ssh-privatekey` by copying the value of (for example)
   `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | base64`.

1. Copy the value of `cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts | base64` to the `known_hosts`
   field.

1. Next, direct a `ServiceAccount` to use this `Secret` (in
   `serviceaccount.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ServiceAccount
   metadata:
     name: build-bot
   secrets:
     - name: ssh-key
   ```

1. Then use that `ServiceAccount` in your `TaskRun` (in `run.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-push-task-run-2
spec:
  serviceAccountName: build-bot
  taskRef:
    name: build-push
```

1. Or use that `ServiceAccount` in your `PipelineRun` (in `run.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: PipelineRun
   metadata:
     name: demo-pipeline
     namespace: default
   spec:
     serviceAccountName: build-bot
     pipelineRef:
       name: demo-pipeline
   ```

1. Execute the `Run`:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename secret.yaml serviceaccount.yaml run.yaml
   ```

When the `Run` executes, before steps execute, a `~/.ssh/config` will be
generated containing the key configured in the `Secret`. This key is then used
to authenticate when retrieving any `PipelineResources`.

## Basic authentication (Git)

1. Define a `Secret` containing the username and password that the `Run` should
   use to authenticate to a Git repository (in `secret.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: basic-user-pass
     annotations:
       tekton.dev/git-0: https://github.com # Described below
   type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
   stringData:
     username: <username>
     password: <password>
   ```

   `tekton.dev/git-0` in the example above specifies which web address these
   credentials belong to. See
   [Guiding Credential Selection](#guiding-credential-selection) below for more
   information.

1. Next, direct a `ServiceAccount` to use this `Secret` (in
   `serviceaccount.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ServiceAccount
   metadata:
     name: build-bot
   secrets:
     - name: basic-user-pass
   ```

1. Then use that `ServiceAccount` in your `TaskRun` (in `run.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: TaskRun
   metadata:
     name: build-push-task-run-2
   spec:
     serviceAccountName: build-bot
     taskRef:
       name: build-push
   ```

1. Or use that `ServiceAccount` in your `PipelineRun` (in `run.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: PipelineRun
   metadata:
     name: demo-pipeline
     namespace: default
   spec:
     serviceAccountName: build-bot
     pipelineRef:
       name: demo-pipeline
   ```

1. Execute the `Run`:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename secret.yaml serviceaccount.yaml run.yaml
   ```

When this `Run` executes, before steps execute, a `~/.gitconfig` will be
generated containing the credentials configured in the `Secret`, and these
credentials are then used to authenticate when retrieving any
`PipelineResources`.

## Basic authentication (Docker)

1. Define a `Secret` containing the username and password that the build should
   use to authenticate to a Docker registry (in `secret.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: basic-user-pass
     annotations:
       tekton.dev/docker-0: https://gcr.io # Described below
   type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
   stringData:
     username: <username>
     password: <password>
   ```

   `tekton.dev/docker-0` in the example above specifies which web address these
   credentials belong to. See
   [Guiding Credential Selection](#guiding-credential-selection) below for more
   information.

1. Next, direct a `ServiceAccount` to use this `Secret` (in
   `serviceaccount.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ServiceAccount
   metadata:
     name: build-bot
   secrets:
     - name: basic-user-pass
   ```

1. Then use that `ServiceAccount` in your `TaskRun` (in `run.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-push-task-run-2
spec:
  serviceAccountName: build-bot
  taskRef:
    name: build-push
```

1. Or use that `ServiceAccount` in your `PipelineRun` (in `run.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: PipelineRun
   metadata:
     name: demo-pipeline
     namespace: default
   spec:
     serviceAccountName: build-bot
     pipelineRef:
       name: demo-pipeline
   ```

1. Execute the `Run`:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename secret.yaml serviceaccount.yaml run.yaml
   ```

When the `Run` executes, before steps execute, a `~/.docker/config.json` will be
generated containing the credentials configured in the `Secret`, and these
credentials are then used to authenticate when retrieving any
`PipelineResources`.

## Kubernetes's Docker registry's secret

Kubernetes defines two types of secrets for Docker registries : 
the old format `kubernetes.io/dockercfg` and the new
`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`. Tekton supports those secrets in
addition to the one described above.

1. Define a `Secret` from a Docker client configuration file, as documented in
   [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic regcred \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
   ```

1. Instruct a `ServiceAccount` to use this `Secret`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ServiceAccount
   metadata:
     name: build-bot
   secrets:
     - name: regcred
   ```

1. Use that `ServiceAccount` in your `TaskRun`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: tetkon.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: TaskRun
   metadata:
     name: build-with-basic-auth
   spec:
     serviceAccountName: build-bot
     steps:
     ...
   ```

1. Execute the build:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename secret.yaml --filename serviceaccount.yaml --filename taskrun.yaml
   ```

When this TaskRun executes, before the steps are getting executed, a
`~/.docker/config.json` will be generated containing the credentials
configured in the `Secret`, and these credentials are then used to
authenticate with the Docker registry.

If both `kubernetes.io/*` and tekton flavored basic authentication secret are
provided, tekton will merge the credentials from those two ; tekton flavored
credentials taking precedence over `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` (or
`kubernetes.io/dockercfg`) ones.

## Guiding credential selection

A `Run` might require many different types of authentication. For instance, a
`Run` might require access to multiple private Git repositories, and access to
many private Docker repositories. You can use annotations to guide which secret
to use to authenticate to different resources, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
    tekton.dev/git-0: https://github.com
    tekton.dev/git-1: https://gitlab.com
    tekton.dev/docker-0: https://gcr.io
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: <cleartext non-encoded>
  password: <cleartext non-encoded>
```

This describes a "Basic Auth" (username and password) secret that should be used
to access Git repos at github.com and gitlab.com, as well as Docker repositories
at gcr.io.

Similarly, for SSH:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
    tekton.dev/git-0: github.com
type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
data:
  ssh-privatekey: <base64 encoded>
  # This is non-standard, but its use is encouraged to make this more secure.
  # Omitting this results in the use of ssh-keyscan (see below).
  known_hosts: <base64 encoded>
```

This describes an SSH key secret that should be used to access Git repos at
github.com only.

Credential annotation keys must begin with `tekton.dev/docker-` or
`tekton.dev/git-`, and the value describes the URL of the host with which to use
the credential.

## Implementation details

### Docker `basic-auth`

Given URLs, usernames, and passwords of the form: `https://url{n}.com`,
`user{n}`, and `pass{n}`, generate the following for Docker:

```json
=== ~/.docker/config.json ===
{
  "auths": {
    "https://url1.com": {
      "auth": "$(echo -n user1:pass1 | base64)",
      "email": "not@val.id",
    },
    "https://url2.com": {
      "auth": "$(echo -n user2:pass2 | base64)",
      "email": "not@val.id",
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

Docker doesn't support `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`, so annotations on these types
are ignored.

### Git `basic-auth`

Given URLs, usernames, and passwords of the form: `https://url{n}.com`,
`user{n}`, and `pass{n}`, generate the following for Git:

```
=== ~/.gitconfig ===
[credential]
    helper = store
[credential "https://url1.com"]
    username = "user1"
[credential "https://url2.com"]
    username = "user2"
...
=== ~/.git-credentials ===
https://user1:pass1@url1.com
https://user2:pass2@url2.com
...
```

### Git `ssh-auth`

Given hostnames, private keys, and `known_hosts` of the form: `url{n}.com`,
`key{n}`, and `known_hosts{n}`, generate the following for Git:

```
=== ~/.ssh/id_key1 ===
{contents of key1}
=== ~/.ssh/id_key2 ===
{contents of key2}
...
=== ~/.ssh/config ===
Host url1.com
    HostName url1.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_key1
Host url2.com
    HostName url2.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_key2
...
=== ~/.ssh/known_hosts ===
{contents of known_hosts1}
{contents of known_hosts2}
...
```

Note: Because `known_hosts` is a non-standard extension of
`kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`, when it is not present this will be generated through
`ssh-keygen url{n}.com` instead.

### Least privilege

The secrets as outlined here will be stored into `$HOME` (by convention the
volume: `/tekton/home`), and will be available to `Source` and all `Steps`.

For sensitive credentials that should not be made available to some steps, do
not use the mechanisms outlined here. Instead, the user should declare an
explicit `Volume` from the `Secret` and manually `VolumeMount` it into the
`Step`.
