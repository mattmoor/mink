# PipelineRuns

This document defines `PipelineRuns` and their capabilities.

On its own, a [`Pipeline`](pipelines.md) declares what [`Tasks`](tasks.md) to
run, and [the order they run in](pipelines.md#ordering). To execute the `Tasks`
in the `Pipeline`, you must create a `PipelineRun`.

Creation of a `PipelineRun` will trigger the creation of
[`TaskRuns`](taskruns.md) for each `Task` in your pipeline.

## Syntax

To define a configuration file for a `PipelineRun` resource, you can specify the
following fields:

- Required:
  - [`apiVersion`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the API version, for example
    `tekton.dev/vbeta1`
  - [`kind`][kubernetes-overview] - Specify the `PipelineRun` resource object.
  - [`metadata`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies data to uniquely identify the
    `PipelineRun` resource object, for example a `name`.
  - [`spec`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the configuration information for
    your `PipelineRun` resource object.
    - [`pipelineRef` or `pipelineSpec`](#specifiying-a-pipeline) - Specifies the [`Pipeline`](pipelines.md) you want to run.
- Optional:
  - [`resources`](#resources) - Specifies which
    [`PipelineResources`](resources.md) to use for this `PipelineRun`.
  - [`params`](#params) - Specifies which params to be passed to the pipeline specified/referenced by this pipeline run.
  - [`serviceAccountName`](#service-account) - Specifies a `ServiceAccount` resource
    object that enables your build to run with the defined authentication
    information. When a `ServiceAccount` isn't specified, the `default-service-account`
    specified in the configmap - config-defaults will be applied.
  - [`serviceAccountNames`](#service-accounts) - Specifies a list of `serviceAccountName`
    and `PipelineTask` pairs that enable you to overwrite a `ServiceAccount` for a concrete `PipelineTask`.
  - `timeout` - Specifies timeout after which the `PipelineRun` will fail. If the value of
    `timeout` is empty, the default timeout will be applied. If the value is set to 0,
    there is no timeout. `PipelineRun` shares the same default timeout as `TaskRun`. You can
    follow the instruction [here](taskruns.md#Configuring-default-timeout) to configure the
    default timeout, the same way as `TaskRun`.
  - [`podTemplate`](#pod-template) - Specifies a [pod template](./podtemplates.md) that will be used as the basis for the `Task` pod.

### Specifying a pipeline

Since a `PipelineRun` is an invocation of a [`Pipeline`](pipelines.md), you must specify
what `Pipeline` to invoke.

You can do this by providing a reference to an existing `Pipeline`:

```yaml
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: mypipeline

```

Or you can embed the spec of the `Pipeline` directly in the `PipelineRun`:

```yaml
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    tasks:
    - name: task1
      taskRef:
        name: mytask
```

[Here](../examples/v1beta1/pipelineruns/pipelinerun-with-pipelinespec.yaml) is a sample `PipelineRun` to display different
greetings while embedding the spec of the `Pipeline` directly in the `PipelineRun`.

After creating such a `PipelineRun`, the logs from this pod are displaying morning greetings:

```bash
kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods -o name | grep pipelinerun-echo-greetings-echo-good-morning)
Good Morning, Bob!
```

And the logs from this pod are displaying evening greetings:

```bash
kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods -o name | grep pipelinerun-echo-greetings-echo-good-night)
Good Night, Bob!
```

Even further you can embed the spec of a `Task` directly in the `Pipeline`:

```yaml
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    tasks:
    - name: task1
      taskSpec:
        steps:
          ...
```

[Here](../examples/v1beta1/pipelineruns/pipelinerun-with-pipelinespec-and-taskspec.yaml) is a sample `PipelineRun` with embedded
the spec of the `Pipeline` directly in the `PipelineRun` along with the spec of the `Task` under `PipelineSpec`.

### Resources

When running a [`Pipeline`](pipelines.md), you will need to specify the
[`PipelineResources`](resources.md) to use with it. One `Pipeline` may need to
be run with different `PipelineResources` in cases such as:

- When triggering the run of a `Pipeline` against a pull request, the triggering
  system must specify the commit-ish of a git `PipelineResource` to use
- When invoking a `Pipeline` manually against one's own setup, one will need to
  ensure one's own GitHub fork (via the git `PipelineResource`), image
  registry (via the image `PipelineResource`) and Kubernetes cluster (via the
  cluster `PipelineResource`).

Specify the `PipelineResources` in the `PipelineRun` using the `resources` section
in the PipelineRun's spec, for example:

```yaml
spec:
  resources:
    - name: source-repo
      resourceRef:
        name: skaffold-git
    - name: web-image
      resourceRef:
        name: skaffold-image-leeroy-web
    - name: app-image
      resourceRef:
        name: skaffold-image-leeroy-app
```

Or you can embed the spec of the `Resource` directly in the `PipelineRun`:

```yaml
spec:
  resources:
    - name: source-repo
      resourceSpec:
        type: git
        params:
          - name: revision
            value: v0.32.0
          - name: url
            value: https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold
    - name: web-image
      resourceSpec:
        type: image
        params:
          - name: url
            value: gcr.io/christiewilson-catfactory/leeroy-web
    - name: app-image
      resourceSpec:
        type: image
        params:
          - name: url
            value: gcr.io/christiewilson-catfactory/leeroy-app
```

### Params

While writing a Pipelinerun, we can specify params that need to be bound to
the input params of the pipeline specified/referenced by the Pipelinerun.

This means that a Pipeline can be run with different input params, by writing Pipelineruns
which bound different input values to the Pipeline params.

```yaml
spec:
  params:
  - name: pl-param-x
    value: "100"
  - name: pl-param-y
    value: "500"
```

### Service Account

Specifies the `name` of a `ServiceAccount` resource object. Use the
`serviceAccountName` field to run your `Pipeline` with the privileges of the
specified service account. If no `serviceAccountName` field is specified, your
resulting `TaskRuns` run using the service account specified in the ConfigMap
`configmap-defaults` which if absent will default to the
[`default` service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#use-the-default-service-account-to-access-the-api-server)
that is in the [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
of the `TaskRun` resource object.

For examples and more information about specifying service accounts, see the
[`ServiceAccount`](./auth.md) reference topic.

### Service Accounts

Specifies the list of `serviceAccountName` and `PipelineTask` pairs. A specified
`PipelineTask` will be run with the configured `ServiceAccount`,
overwriting the [`serviceAccountName`](#service-account) configuration, for example:

```yaml
spec:
  serviceAccountName: sa-1
  serviceAccountNames:
    - taskName: build-task
      serviceAccountName: sa-for-build
```

If used with this `Pipeline`, `test-task` will use the `ServiceAccount` `sa-1`, while `build-task` will use `sa-for-build`.

```yaml
kind: Pipeline
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: build-task
      taskRef:
        name: build-push
    - name: test-task
      taskRef:
        name: test
```

### Pod Template

Specifies a [pod template](./podtemplates.md) configuration that will be used as the basis for the `Task` pod. This
allows to customize some Pod specific field per `Task` execution, aka `TaskRun`.

In the following example, the `Task` is defined with a `volumeMount`
(`my-cache`), that is provided by the `PipelineRun`, using a
`persistentVolumeClaim`. The Pod will also run as a non-root user.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: mytask
spec:
  steps:
    - name: writesomething
      image: ubuntu
      command: ["bash", "-c"]
      args: ["echo 'foo' > /my-cache/bar"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: my-cache
          mountPath: /my-cache
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: mypipeline
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: task1
      taskRef:
        name: mytask
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: mypipelinerun
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: mypipeline
  podTemplate:
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
    volumes:
    - name: my-cache
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-volume-claim
```

## PersistentVolumeClaims

Any persistent volume claims within a `PipelineRun` are bound until the
corresponding `PipelineRun` or pods are deleted. This also applies to any
internally generated persistent volume claims.

## Workspaces

For a `PipelineRun` to execute a `Pipeline` that declares `workspaces` it needs to map
those `workspaces` to actual physical volumes.

Here are the relevant fields of a `PipelineRun` spec when providing a
`PersistentVolumeClaim` as a workspace:

```yaml
workspaces:
- name: myworkspace # must match workspace name in Task
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: mypvc # this PVC must already exist
  subPath: my-subdir
```

For more examples and complete documentation on configuring `workspaces` in
`PipelineRun`s see [workspaces.md](./workspaces.md#providing-workspaces-with-pipelineruns).

Tekton supports several different kinds of `Volume` in `Workspaces`. For a list of
the different kinds see the section on
[`VolumeSources` for Workspaces](workspaces.md#volumesources-for-workspaces).

_For a complete example see [the Workspaces PipelineRun](../examples/v1beta1/pipelineruns/workspaces.yaml)
in the examples directory._

## Cancelling a PipelineRun

In order to cancel a running pipeline (`PipelineRun`), you need to update its
spec to mark it as cancelled. Related `TaskRun` instances will be marked as
cancelled and running Pods will be deleted.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: go-example-git
spec:
  # […]
  status: "PipelineRunCancelled"
```

## LimitRanges

In order to request the minimum amount of resources needed to support the containers
for `steps` that are part of a `TaskRun`, Tekton only requests the maximum values for CPU,
memory, and ephemeral storage from the `steps` that are part of a TaskRun. Only the max
resource request values are needed since `steps` only execute one at a time in a `TaskRun` pod.
All requests that are not the max values are set to zero as a result.

When a [LimitRange](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/) is present in a namespace
with a minimum set for container resource requests (i.e. CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage) where `PipelineRuns`
are attempting to run, Tekton will search through all LimitRanges present in the namespace and use the minimum
set for container resource requests instead of requesting 0.

An example `PipelineRun` with a LimitRange is available [here](../examples/v1beta1/pipelineruns/no-ci/limitrange.yaml).
