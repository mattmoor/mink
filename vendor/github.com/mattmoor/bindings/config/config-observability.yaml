    ################################

    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # If non-empty, this enables queue proxy writing request logs to stdout.
    # The value determines the shape of the request logs and it must be a valid go text/template.
    # It is important to keep this as a single line. Multiple lines are parsed as separate entities
    # by most collection agents and will split the request logs into multiple records.
    #
    # The following fields and functions are available to the template:
    #
    # Request: An http.Request (see https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request)
    # representing an HTTP request received by the server.
    #
    # Response:
    # struct {
    #   Code    int       // HTTP status code (see https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml)
    #   Size    int       // An int representing the size of the response.
    #   Latency float64   // A float64 representing the latency of the response in seconds.
    # }
    #
    # Revision:
    # struct {
    #   Name          string  // Knative revision name
    #   Namespace     string  // Knative revision namespace
    #   Service       string  // Knative service name
    #   Configuration string  // Knative configuration name
    #   PodName       string  // Name of the pod hosting the revision
    #   PodIP         string  // IP of the pod hosting the revision
