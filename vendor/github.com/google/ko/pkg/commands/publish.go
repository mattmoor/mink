		Example: `
  # Build and publish import path references to a Docker
  # Registry as:
  #   ${KO_DOCKER_REPO}/<package name>-<hash of import path>
  # When KO_DOCKER_REPO is ko.local, it is the same as if
  # --local and --preserve-import-paths were passed.
  ko publish github.com/foo/bar/cmd/baz github.com/foo/bar/cmd/blah

  # Build and publish a relative import path as:
  #   ${KO_DOCKER_REPO}/<package name>-<hash of import path>
  # When KO_DOCKER_REPO is ko.local, it is the same as if
  # --local and --preserve-import-paths were passed.
  ko publish ./cmd/blah

  # Build and publish a relative import path as:
  #   ${KO_DOCKER_REPO}/<import path>
  # When KO_DOCKER_REPO is ko.local, it is the same as if
  # --local was passed.
  ko publish --preserve-import-paths ./cmd/blah

  # Build and publish import path references to a Docker
  # daemon as:
  #   ko.local/<import path>
  # This always preserves import paths.
  ko publish --local github.com/foo/bar/cmd/baz github.com/foo/bar/cmd/blah`,
